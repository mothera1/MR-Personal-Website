        <p>
          As General Manager of WZBC-Newton 90.3 I wanted to create a faux
          spotify wrapped for my friend's and my radio shows. I achieved this by
          creating a React app called
          <a href="http://spinalytics.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/"
            >Spinalytics</a
          >. The website details the top 10 Artists, Songs, and Genres for 3
          different shows at WZBC. This app is in the early stages of
          development, with the end goal of having all shows at WZBC documented.
          To get the data I used a python based web scraper called Scrapy, which
          I used to collect data off of
          <a href="https://spinitron.com/WZBC/calendar">Spinitron</a> which
          catelogues the songs played for each show. I then used AWS Timestream
          DB to house the data, Lambda to query the DB, API gateway and Postman
          for the restful API, and finally S3 buckets to host the react app.
