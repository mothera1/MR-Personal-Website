        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="SBIR.html"> SBIR Database Analysis </a></li>
          <p>
            Used Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Machine Learning
            techniques to analyze the
            <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/awards">SBIR Award Database</a>, with
            the goal of identifying key funding targets for the DoD. Funding
            targets were classified and into different technology groups through
            TF-IDF, UMAP, and K-Means.
          </p>
          <li><a href="Spinalytics.html"> Spinalytics </a></li>
          <p>
            Developed a react app called
            <a href="http://spinalytics.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/"
              >Spinalytics</a
            >
            that documents the top artists, songs, and genres for me and my
            friend's radio shows at WZBC. The app was created with data scraped
            from Spinitron (Service that catelogues songs played on WZBC) and
            hosted with AWS.
