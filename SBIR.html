      <h1>SBIR Award Database Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        The SBIR Award Database Analysis was done during my internship at
        <a href="https://theoutpost.com/">The Outpost</a>. Data was collected
        from the
        <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/awards">SBIR Award Database</a> and the
        descriptions for each individual award were vectorized using Open-AI's
        ada model and TF-IDF. These vectors then underwent dimentionality
        reduction through UMAP and clustering with HDBSCAN and K-Means. I then
        presented insights from the report to account managers, allowing them
        more accurately match their clients with sectors of the DoD for
        contracts.
